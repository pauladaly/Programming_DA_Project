# Programming_DA_Project
Submitted by Paula Daly

This repository contains the Jupyter notebook Programming_DA_Project.ipynb for the Programming for Data Analysis Project.

For this project we were tasked with synthesizing a data set for a real-world phenomenon and the projected includes:

 - Choose a real-world phenomenon that can be measured and for which you could collect at least one-hundred data points across at least four different variables.
 - Investigate the types of variables involved, their likely distributions, and their relationships with each other.
 - Synthesise/simulate a data set as closely matching their properties as possible.
 - Detail your research and implement the simulation in a Jupyter notebook â€“ the data set itself can simply be displayed in an output cell within the notebook.

 To run the Jupyter notebook file you will need to have Python installed through Anaconda Distribution to ensure you have all the relevant packages required to run the jupyter notebook and CMDer will also be required to be installed.
 
 In CMDer you can clone the repository https://github.com/pauladaly/Programming_DA_Project.git.  Once the repository is cloned to your system to open the Jupyter notebook on the command line enter: Jupyter notebook.
